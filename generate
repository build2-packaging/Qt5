# Create the infrastructure required by our Qt packages:
#
# - Create a source layout more suitable to our purposes which is still
#   compatible with the Qt upstream (the way they include stuff, etc).
#
# - Separate private headers to a deeper directory subtree to prevent them
#   from being found without the addition of the header search directories
#   exported by the lib{Qt5CorePrivate} and similar targets.
#
#   For QtGui, for example, the public headers are under libQt5Gui/QtGui/
#   while the private headers are under
#   libQt5Gui/QtGui/private/QtGui/{private,qpa}/. Thus include paths such as
#   <QtGui/private/foo_p.h> or <private/foo_p.h> will not work without
#   lib{Qt5GuiPrivate}'s exported poptions of "-IlibQt5Gui/QtGui/private
#   -IlibQt5Gui/QtGui/private/QtGui".
#
# - Most upstream files are symlinked into our source layout but in some cases
#   this is not possible. The upstream build runs a script, syncqt.pl, for
#   each module which rearranges its public headers to be fit for consumption
#   by their clients (other Qt modules and Qt users). For example, it
#   generates camelcase-named versions of the public headers and groups
#   headers from different source subdirectories into the same directory, the
#   name of which clients then use in their include paths. Because these
#   conversions are not trivial enough to reproduce here we cannot symlink to
#   the original sources so we copy them from the script's output directories
#   instead.
