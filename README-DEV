1. Licensing

1.1. Qt Core

License choices:

  a) Qt Commercial License

  b) GPL v2-only or GPL v3-only

  c) LGPL v3-only

1.2. Meta-Object Compiler (MOC)

License choices:

  a) Qt Commercial License

  b) GPL v3-only with exceptions granted by Qt
     (upstream/qtbase/LICENSE.GPL3-EXCEPT). These exceptions relax the
     GPLv3. For example, it allows a work that contains, but does not output
     itself, MOC output (such as a program compiled with MOC-generated source
     files) to be distributed under any terms.

2. Qt mailing lists

They're listed on qt-project.org which is a fact not easy to discover starting
from https://qt.io/ but see https://wiki.qt.io/Online_Communities.
