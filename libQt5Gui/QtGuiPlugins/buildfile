# This library presents a single target that depends on all of the plugins
# used by libQt5Gui. Not only is this more convenient than having to import
# and depend on multiple plugin targets, but its .pc file will be installed to
# lib/pkgconfig/, unlike those of the actual plugin libraries which are
# installed under lib/qt5/plugins/ (next to the libraries themselves) where
# they will not be found.
